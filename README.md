# Day-Planner
A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day

## Description

This application displays the hours in a standard work day (9am-5pm) and allows you to write notes or event information for each hour.  After clicking the save button, the event notes will persist upon page refreshes.  Each hour is color coded depending on whether it is in the past, present, or future, allowing you to determine what event is active at a quick glance.

This assignment was a good way to familiarize myself with JQuery and Moment.js.  Moment.js is a very powerful and convenient library for date formatting and manipulation -- borrowing many syntax aspects from JQuery (such as overloaded getters and setters).  The time blocks are dynamically generated using JQuery, using Moment.js to determine the hour and color of the blocks.
